            <h2><a href="">Kimchi workshop | EAT THE WORLD SERIES</a></h2>
            <p>Kimchi is the result of a powerful combination of fermented cabbage and chilli. It uses up all our senses by distracting us with the pungent smell and continues the theatre by performing a merry dance of salty, spicy, garlicky and sweet. Only 2 days left to our Kimchi workshop!.</p>
